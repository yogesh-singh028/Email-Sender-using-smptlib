This is a first version of my Mail sender GUI project in which you can mail to more 
then one user at a time but just add a comma " , " betwwen two receiver  email id .

this GUI also have a login option which stores your email and password details for a specific time
because i didn't use any data base support for storing them and if you want you
can add a database for making it more reliable .

i tried to add more features in it but i am facing lots of error with them but
 
... please read all the comments which i add in the source code file .

and no need to install smptlib it is already in you system ..

Working of project ...

after opening the GUI make sure you add your gmail and password by clicking on the login button.
you can add mmultiple receiver email id but seperated by commans and no space in betwwen them .

please amke sure to add all fields other wise you can face some beautiful errors ..
